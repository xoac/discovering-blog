My name is **Sylwester Rąpała** I am from Poland. I have created this blog for two purposes:
- discovering stuff by writing about them (mostly about Rust)
- learning English

You can find me on [github](https://github.com/xoac/).

In free time I play boardgames. I like hitchhiking (you can meet interesting people). A good place where you can find open minded people is [couchserfing](https://www.couchsurfing.com/). If you know a place where people play charades online write me about it!
